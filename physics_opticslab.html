      <!--The WebGL OpticsLab build -->
      <p>
        The WebGL build embedded below shows the basic functionality of the simulation (now on version 1.2) and is available
        at <a href="https://simmer.io/@dpreid/opticslab"> simmer.io </a>. It is at a lower quality than the
        standalone build that it is available at <a href="https://github.com/dpreid/opticsLab"> OpticsLab </a>.
      </p>

        <!-- Introduction -->
<p>
  Optics Lab is a series of optical simulations to help teachers teach and learners learn. It currently contains
  a number of optical systems that are important for GCSE and A level Physics (particularly Astrophysics and Medical Physics)
  and will be relevant to many other secondary education systems. The simulations utilise ray tracing matrices and therefore
  assume the paraxial approximation which ultimately means that accuracy is reduced the further from the optical axis a ray is
  and the greater the angle it interacts with the optic. More on the maths of ray tracing will be added to a tutorial below.
  A WebGL embedded version of the software is available below, but a higher resolution version can be downloaded for Windows, Mac or
  Linux on GitHub.
</p>
<p>
    Downloadable standalone versions of the software will be available in the future.
</p>

      <!--Optics lab tutorial 1 section -->
  <h2 id="opticsLabTutorial1"> Optics Lab Tutorial 1: Basic functionality </h2>
  <p>
      This first tutorial will give an overview of the basic functions of the Optics Lab software and an
      idea of the kinds of simulations/experiments/measurements that can be done.
  </p>
  <h3> Controls</h3>
  <p>
    All simulations are controlled with the mouse and keyboard: the general rule is that the left mouse button
    can be used to move rayboxes and optics and the right mouse button is used for measurements of distance and angle.
    The <b>rayboxes</b> can be left clicked on directly to translate them; left clicking on the red square next to them allows for
    rotation. They can also be rotated by directly inputing the angle of rotation in the corresponding raybox angle textbox on the
    user interface. The <b>lenses</b> are fixed in position unless the have a blue square next to them: left clicking this
    blue square allows you to translate the position of them - optics cannot (currently) be rotated. Some simulations will allow
    <b>zooming in and out of the scene with the scroll wheel on a mouse</b>. The sandbox scene (where you can build your own optical systems)
    allows for <b>camera movement with the WASD keys</b>.
  </p>
  <h3> Measurements</h3>
  <p>
    For many of the simulations it is useful to be able to <b>measure distances</b> (focal lengths for example) and <b>angles</b> (refractive index).
    With the "Ruler" button showing, right clicking at a position will show a crosshair at that location. Right click at another
    position and a second crosshair will appear with a connecting bar between the two. The distance between these two crosshairs
    will be displayed next to the "Ruler" button. Left clicking the ruler button will change it to a "Protractor" in order to make
    angle measurements. With the "Protractor" showing, clicking at 3 locations will display the inner angle connecting these 3 positions.
    Moveable axes (vertical and horizontal) can be positioned to make measuring angles easier.
  </p>
  <h3> Simulations and Experiments</h3>
  <p>
    A number of important optical systems have been predesigned and can be found by clicking <i>Start</i> in the initial menu. Currently, the
    refractive index, focal length or radius of curvature of these optics cannot be changed. However, the <i><b>Sandbox</b></i> scene allows for
    much more customisation and by entering a value in the textbox beneath the optic and then clicking on the UI image of that optic, it will be
    created with the input refractive index or focal length.
  </p>
  <p>
      The details of individual simulations and the experiments that can be performed with them will be left to separate tutorials, but here is
      a (non-exhaustive) list of possibilities.
  <ul>
    <li>Angular magnification with a refracting telescope</li>
      <li>Refracting telescope in normal adjustment</li>
      <li>Newtonian reflector</li>
      <li>Refractive index of glass block: measuring the angles of incidence and refraction of a parallel sided prism</li>
      <li> Thin lens focal point</li>
      <li> Real and virtual images for a thin lens</li>
      <li>Magnification with a thin lens</li>
      <li> Build simulations of the eye with convex and concave glasses lenses</li>
    </ul>

<!--Tutorial 2 Refracting telescope -->
<h2 id="opticsLabTutorial2"> Optics Lab Tutorial 2: Refracting Telescope </h2>

</figure>

<p>
  At its most basic, the refracting telescope is a combination of a long focal length objective lens that is used to focus
  the light from your object in order to form an image of it and a shorter focal length eyepiece lens which magnifies that image.
  Fig. 1 shows this basic layout which can be demonstrated in the Refracting Telescope scene of Optics Lab. This telescope is also
  setup in normal adjustment: parallel rays entering the objective, leave the eyepiece as parallel rays. Normal adjustment
  requires that the distance between your lenses is equal to the sum of their focal lengths.
</p>
<p>
    (1) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;     f<sub>obj</sub> + f<sub>eye</sub> = d
</p>

<p>
  Using the <b>ruler tool</b> on Optics Lab we can measure the focal lengths of these lenses. The principal focus is the focal point of
  parallel rays entering the lens. We can see in Fig. 1 that parallel rays enter the objective therefore the focus
  is the principle focus and measuring the length from the centre of the lens to that focus gives us the focal length of that lens.
  Similarly, since our telescope is in normal adjustment, the rays entering the eyepiece leave parallal, so the distance between this
  lens at the focal point is the focal length of that lens.
</p>
<p>
  <b>TASK 1</b>: Measure the focal length of each lens and show that when the telescope is in normal adjustment, equation (1) holds.
</p>
<p>
  The angular magnification of a telescope tells you how many times larger the angular separation between stars will appear through the telescope
  as compared to the naked eye.
</p>

<p>
    (2) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;     M = &beta;/&alpha;
</p>
<p>
  Where &alpha; is the angle between the optical axis and the rays entering the objective and &beta; is the angle between the optical axis
  and the rays leaving the eyepiece.
</p>
<p>
  <b>TASK 2</b>: Use the protractor tool to measure the angles &alpha; and &beta;. Move the horizontal axis into a position to act as the
  optical axis. Calculate the angular magnification of this telescope. Fig. 3 gives an example of measuring the angle &beta;.
</p>

<p>
  The angular magnification of the telescope can be found more easily by finding the ratio of the focal lengths of the telescope lenses.
</p>
<p>
    (3) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;     M = f<sub>obj</sub>/f<sub>eye</sub>
</p>
<p>
    <b>TASK 3</b>: Compare the magnification found in TASK 2 with that using the ratios of the focal lengths. You should find that you get the
    same value.
</p>

<h2 id="opticsLabTutorial3"> Tutorial 3: Measuring the refractive index </h2>

<p>
  The Optics Lab simulation gives students the opportunity to measure the refractive index of differently shaped lenses as well
  as for any refractive index (as this can be set). The sandbox scene will be used for this tutorial, as well as the protractor
  measuring tool.
</p>
<p>
  <b>TASK 1</b>: Open up the Sandbox level and add a parallel sided prism to the scene. The default refractive index is 1.5 or you
  can input the refractive index in the textbox under the optic image before clicking it to set the refractive index to whatever you like.
</p>
<p>
    The refractive index of a material is defined as the ratio between the speed of light in a vacuum(c) and the speed of light
     in that material (c<sub>m</sub>).
</p>
<p>
    (1) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;     n = c/c<sub>m</sub>
</p>
<p>
    It can also be defined in terms of the angles of a ray as it enters or exits the lens, with Snell's Law (eq 2 below) giving us the
    relationship, where the 1 and 2 values are for the angle and refractive index in the two materials across the boundary of which
    the ray is refracting.
</p>
<p>
    (2) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;     n<sub>1</sub>sin&theta;<sub>1</sub> = n<sub>2</sub>sin&theta;<sub>2</sub>
</p>
  <b>TASK 2</b>: Move two of the rayboxes out of the way and set one raybox to a any angle. Position the horizontal axis to form
  a normal line. Use the mouse scroll and WASD keys to centre and zoom to make the measuring as accurate as possible. An example is
  shown in Fig. 1.

    <img src="images/physics/refractionParallelPrism.PNG" alt="refractionparallel">
    <figcaption> Fig.1: Setup for measuring the refractive index of a parallel prism. Taken from Optics Lab > Sandbox scene.</figcaption>
  </figure>

<p>
<b>TASK 3</b>: Set the angle of the raybox by rotating it with red button or setting the angle with the raybox input field.
Use the protractor to check the angle that you have set. Measure the angle of refraction inside the parallel prism as shown in
Fig. 2.
</p>

</figure>

<p>
<b>TASK 4</b>: Use Snell's Law and the fact that the refractive index of a vacuum is 1 (the simulation assumes
that a vacuum surrounds the lenses) to calculate the refractive index of the lens.
