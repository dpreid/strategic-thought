      <p>
        The WebGL build embedded below shows the basic functionality of the simulation (now on version 1.5) and is available
        at <a href="https://simmer.io/@dpreid/opticslab"> simmer.io </a>. C# code for the simulations are available at
      <a href="https://github.com/dpreid/opticsLab"> OpticsLab </a>.
      </p>

        <!-- Introduction -->
<p>
  Optics Lab is a series of optical simulations to help teachers teach and learners learn. It currently contains
  a number of optical systems that are important for GCSE and A level Physics (particularly Astrophysics and Medical Physics)
  and will be relevant to many other secondary education systems. The simulations utilise ray tracing matrices and therefore
  assume the paraxial approximation which ultimately means that accuracy is reduced the further from the optical axis a ray is
  and the greater the angle it interacts with the optic. More on the maths of ray tracing will be added to a tutorial below.
  A WebGL embedded version of the software is available below.

      <!--Optics lab tutorial 0 section -->
  <h2 id="opticsLabTutorial0"> Optics Lab Tutorial 0: Basic functionality </h2>
  <p>
      This first tutorial will give an overview of the basic functions of the Optics Lab software and an
      idea of the kinds of simulations/experiments/measurements that can be done.
  </p>
  <h3> Controls</h3>
  <p>
    All simulations are controlled with the mouse and keyboard: the general rule is that the left mouse button
    can be used to move rayboxes and optics and the right mouse button is used for measurements of distance and angle.
    The <b>rayboxes</b> can be left clicked on directly to translate them; left clicking on the red square next to them allows for
    rotation. They can also be rotated by directly inputing the angle of rotation in the corresponding raybox angle textbox on the
    user interface. The <b>lenses</b> are fixed in position unless the have a blue square next to them: left clicking this
    blue square allows you to translate the position of them - optics cannot (currently) be rotated. Some simulations will allow
    <b>zooming in and out of the scene with the scroll wheel on a mouse</b>. The sandbox scene (where you can build your own optical systems)
    allows for <b>camera movement with the WASD keys</b>.
  </p>
  <h3> Measurements</h3>
  <p>
    For many of the simulations it is useful to be able to <b>measure distances</b> (focal lengths for example) and <b>angles</b> (refractive index).
    With the "Ruler" button showing, right clicking at a position will show a crosshair at that location. Right click at another
    position and a second crosshair will appear with a connecting bar between the two. The distance between these two crosshairs
    will be displayed next to the "Ruler" button. Left clicking the ruler button will change it to a "Protractor" in order to make
    angle measurements. With the "Protractor" showing, clicking at 3 locations will display the inner angle connecting these 3 positions.
    Moveable axes (vertical and horizontal) can be positioned to make measuring angles easier.
  </p>
  <h3> Simulations and Experiments</h3>
  <p>
    A number of important optical systems have been predesigned and can be found by clicking <i>Start</i> in the initial menu. The <i><b>Sandbox</b></i> scene allows for
    much more customisation and by entering a value in the textbox beneath the optic and then clicking on the UI image of that optic, it will be
    created with the input refractive index or focal length.
  </p>
  <p>
      The details of individual simulations and the experiments that can be performed with them will be left to separate tutorials, but here is
      a (non-exhaustive) list of possibilities.
  <ul>
    <li>Angular magnification with a refracting telescope</li>
      <li>Refracting telescope in normal adjustment</li>
      <li>Newtonian reflector</li>
      <li>Refractive index of glass block: measuring the angles of incidence and refraction of a parallel sided prism</li>
      <li> Thin lens focal point</li>
      <li> Real and virtual images for a thin lens</li>
      <li>Magnification with a thin lens</li>
      <li> Build simulations of the eye with convex and concave glasses lenses</li>
    </ul>

<!--Tutorial 1 Refracting telescope -->
<h2 id="opticsLabTutorial1"> Optics Lab Tutorial 1: Refracting Telescope </h2>

<figure>
  <img src="images/physics/refractornormaladjustment.PNG" alt="normaladjustment">
  <figcaption> Fig. 1.1: The basic layout of a refracting telescope in normal adjustment. Taken from Optics Lab.</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>
  At its most basic, the refracting telescope is a combination of a long focal length objective lens that is used to focus
  the light from your object in order to form an image of it and a shorter focal length eyepiece lens which magnifies that image.
  Fig. 1.1 shows this basic layout which can be demonstrated in the Refracting Telescope scene of Optics Lab. This telescope is also
  setup in normal adjustment: parallel rays entering the objective, leave the eyepiece as parallel rays. Normal adjustment
  requires that the distance between your lenses is equal to the sum of their focal lengths.
</p>
<p>
    (1.1) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;     f<sub>obj</sub> + f<sub>eye</sub> = d
</p>

<p>
  Using the <b>ruler tool</b> on Optics Lab we can measure the focal lengths of these lenses. The principal focus is the focal point of
  parallel rays entering the lens. We can see in Fig. 1.1 that parallel rays enter the objective therefore the focus
  is the principle focus and measuring the length from the centre of the lens to that focus gives us the focal length of that lens.
  Similarly, since our telescope is in normal adjustment, the rays entering the eyepiece leave parallal, so the distance between this
  lens at the focal point is the focal length of that lens.
</p>
<p>
  <b>TASK 1</b>: Measure the focal length of each lens and show that when the telescope is in normal adjustment, equation (1.1) holds.
</p>
<p>
  The angular magnification of a telescope tells you how many times larger the angular separation between stars will appear through the telescope
  as compared to the naked eye.
</p>

<figure>

</figure>

<p>
    (1.2) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;     M = &beta;/&alpha;
</p>
<p>
  Where &alpha; is the angle between the optical axis and the rays entering the objective and &beta; is the angle between the optical axis
  and the rays leaving the eyepiece.
</p>
<p>
  <b>TASK 2</b>: Use the protractor tool to measure the angles &alpha; and &beta;. Move the horizontal axis into a position to act as the
  optical axis. Calculate the angular magnification of this telescope. Fig. 1.3 gives an example of measuring the angle &beta;.
</p>

<p>
  The angular magnification of the telescope can be found more easily by finding the ratio of the focal lengths of the telescope lenses.
</p>
<p>
    (1.3) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;     M = f<sub>obj</sub>/f<sub>eye</sub>
</p>
<p>
    <b>TASK 3</b>: Compare the magnification found in TASK 2 with that using the ratios of the focal lengths. You should find that you get the
    same value.
</p>

<h2 id="opticsLabTutorial2"> Tutorial 2: Measuring the refractive index </h2>

<p>
  The Optics Lab simulation gives students the opportunity to measure the refractive index of differently shaped lenses as well
  as for any refractive index (as this can be set). The sandbox scene will be used for this tutorial, as well as the protractor
  measuring tool.
</p>
<p>
  <b>TASK 1</b>: Open up the Sandbox level and add a parallel sided prism to the scene. The default refractive index is 1.5 or you
  can input the refractive index in the textbox under the optic image before clicking it to set the refractive index to whatever you like.
</p>
<p>
    The refractive index of a material is defined as the ratio between the speed of light in a vacuum(c) and the speed of light
     in that material (c<sub>m</sub>).
</p>
<p>
    (2.1) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;     n = c/c<sub>m</sub>
</p>
<p>
    It can also be defined in terms of the angles of a ray as it enters or exits the lens, with Snell's Law (eq 2.2 below) giving us the
    relationship, where the 1 and 2 values are for the angle and refractive index in the two materials across the boundary of which
    the ray is refracting.
</p>
<p>
    (2.2) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;     n<sub>1</sub>sin&theta;<sub>1</sub> = n<sub>2</sub>sin&theta;<sub>2</sub>
</p>
  <b>TASK 2</b>: Move two of the rayboxes out of the way and set one raybox to any angle. Position the horizontal axis to form
  a normal line. Use the mouse scroll and WASD keys to centre and zoom to make the measuring as accurate as possible. An example is
  shown in Fig. 2.1.

    <figcaption> Fig. 2.1: Setup for measuring the refractive index of a parallel prism. Taken from Optics Lab > Sandbox scene.</figcaption>
  </figure>

<p>
<b>TASK 3</b>: Set the angle of the raybox by rotating it with red button or setting the angle with the raybox input field.
Use the protractor to check the angle that you have set. Measure the angle of refraction inside the parallel prism as shown in
Fig. 2.2.
</p>

<p>
<b>TASK 4</b>: Use Snell's Law and the fact that the refractive index of a vacuum is 1 (the simulation assumes
that a vacuum surrounds the lenses) to calculate the refractive index of the lens.
</p>

<!--Tutorial 3 Magnification -->
<h2 id="opticsLabTutorial3"> Optics Lab Tutorial 3: Magnification </h2>

<p>
  GCSE students need to learn to ray trace through a thin convex lens in order to produce both real and virtual images. Optics Lab can
  be used to supplement the ray tracing diagrams that they need to learn. In this scene two appropriate rays are traced from the
  raybox in order to find the image position. Distance measurements will need to be done with the Ruler tool. The focal length (f) of the
  lens is the distance from the centre of the lens to the position where the green ray crosses the optical axis (blue horizontal line).
</p>

<p>
  Real images are formed in optical systems when rays actually converge at a point: these focused rays can be projected onto a screen.
  Virtual images cannot be projected onto a screen but only "appear" to come from a point from which rays are diverging.
</p>

<p>
    <b>TASK 1</b>: Open up the Magnifying Glass scene. Set the raybox (object) far from the lens. What is true about the properties
    of the image that is formed (green line)?
</p>

<p>
    All images can be described as upright or inverted; magnified or diminished; and real or virtual. We are going to compare the image
    properties when the object starts at different distances from the lens.
</p>
<p>
  <b>TASK 2</b>: Find the object distance and image distance (from the lens) when a real image is formed of magnification x1.
  The distance to the object should be measured to the centre of the raybox. You should find that your scene looks similar to
  Fig 3.1.
</p>

<figure>
  <img src="images/physics/magnification2f.PNG" alt="mag2f">
  <figcaption> Fig. 3.1: A real, magnification x1 image. Taken from Optics Lab > Magnifying Glass scene.</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>
  The magnification is simply the ratio of the image height to the object height as expressed in Equation 3.1.
</p>

<p>
  (3.1) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;     h<sub>I</sub>/h<sub>o</sub>
</p>

<p>
    <b>TASK 3</b>: Prove to yourself that the magnification is found using Equation 3.1. Remember to measure to the centre of the raybox
    when measuring the objects height.
</p>
<p>
  As the object moves closer to the lens (between 2f and f away from the lens) the image should become magnified, but remain real and
  inverted.
</p>
<p>
  <b>TASK 4</b>: What happens to the image as you reach an object distance equal to f and then move inside this distance? Describe the
  image formed?
</p>
<p>
  When the object is a distance f away from the lens, the image is said to be formed at infinity since parallel rays will not converge
  at any position. Fig. 3.2 shows this condition and we can see that the green and yellow rays are parallel to each other.
</p>

<!--Tutorial 4 Eyes and glasses -->
<h2 id="opticsLabTutorial4"> Optics Lab Tutorial 4: Eyes and glasses </h2>

<p>
    The structure of the eye as well as the lenses used to correct any eye defects are a common context in IGCSE Physics
    for studying lenses. Figure 4.1 shows the opening setup for the "Eye corrections" scene in Optics Lab. Although not
    annotated, the simulation includes a fixed lens to represent the cornea at the front of the eye; a variable focal length eye lens;
    and variable focal length concave and convex lenses to represent glasses. The simulation can be used to show what happens to
    the eye lens in order to focus on objects at different distances and what lenses need to be used in glasses in order to correct
    for short and long sightedness.
</p>

<figure>
  <img src="images/physics/eyecorrectionStart.PNG" alt="eye">
  <figcaption> Fig. 4.1: The initial setup of the eye corrections scene. The focal length of the eye lens
    can be changed and concave and convex glasses can be added. Taken from Optics Lab > Eye corrections scene.</figcaption>
</figure>

<h3> Normal vision</h3>

<p>
  <b>TASK 1</b>: Reorientate Ryaboxes 1 and 3 in order to have them project at a small angle up and down
  (I set them to -4 (or 356) and 4 degrees). Position all three at a relatively large distance in order to simulate the eye
  receiving light from a distant object. Without changing the eye lens focal length, use the vertical axis to mark the focal point of the eye.
  Fig 4.2a gives an example of this setup.
</p>
<p>
  <b>TASK 2</b>: What must happen to the eye lens, in terms of thickness and focal length, in order to get a focused image of the distant object?
</p>

    focus light on the retina. Taken from Optics Lab > Eye corrections scene.</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>
  <b>TASK 3</b>: Keeping the lens focal length the same as in Task 2, move the two diverging rays closer to the eye (as shown in Fig 4.3).
  Describe the problem with forming a focused image now. What must the eye lens do in order to focus the light?
</p>

    focal length in order to focus the image. Taken from Optics Lab > Eye corrections scene.</figcaption>
</figure>

<h3> Corrected vision: Long sighted</h3>

<p>
    Hyperopia or long sightedness is a condition whereby the eye lens cannot reach short enough focal lengths: either
    due to the curvature of the cornea or lens or because the eye ball itself is too short. Objects at large distances can
    be focused but nearby objects will appear out of focus. Figure 4.4a shows the cause of this: light is focused beyond the retina.
</p>

<p>
  <b>TASK 4</b>: Which lens should be used in order to correct for long sightedness? Test this out by moving your chosen lens in front
  of the eye and seeing whether it helps correct the defect. You may need to change the focal length of the lens to get perfect focus.
  Figure 4.4b is hidden, but hover over it and it will reveal the answer.

</figure>

<h3> Corrected vision: short sighted</h3>

<p>
    Myopia or short sightedness is effectively the opporite effect to long sightedness: the eyeball itself is too long
    or the lenses cannot focus far enough away. Objects at short distances can
    be focused but faraway objects will appear out of focus. Figure 4.5a shows the cause of this: light is focused in front of the retina.
</p>

<p>
  <b>TASK 5</b>: Which lens should be used in order to correct for short sightedness? Test this out by moving your chosen lens in front
  of the eye and seeing whether it helps correct the defect. You may need to change the focal length of the lens to get perfect focus.
