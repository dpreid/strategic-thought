<!--Tutorial 0: Basic functionality -->

<h2 id="mechanicslabtutorial0"> Tutorial 0: Mechanics Lab basics</h2>

<p>
  Each simulation in Mechanics Lab is designed to encourage students to experiment, measure and calculate - they will not necessarily
  provide the answers to problems: but the correct behaviour in a simulation will probably indicate a correct solution. Many of the
  simulations will include moveable horizontal and vertical axes; multiple input fields for different variables; a ruler tool for measuring
  distances; and a protractor tool for measuring angles. This is a basic run through of these key interactive elements and will be useful
  for accessing any of the simulations (although most can hopefully be figured out by simply playing with the software).
</p>

<h3> Measuring tools</h3>

<p>
The ruler tool is selected by default and is shown at the bottom of most simulations. To make a measurement with this tool simply right-click
at the two points between which you want to measure the distance. Two crosshairs will show and next to the ruler button will be displayed the
distance (see Fig 0.1). The scale is based upon the standard Unity scale (the engine used to create these simulations)- but apply any unit you wish.
</p>

<figure>
  <img src="images/physics/MechanicsLabImages/mechLabTutorial0Ruler.PNG" alt="ruler">
  <figcaption> Fig 0.1: The ruler tool measures the distance between two points.</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>
  Some simulations will also include a protractor tool (important in 2D momentum calculations for example). In order to change to the protractor
  tool, simply left click on the "Ruler" button. Angle measurements can now be made by clicking at 3 points. If your first point is A, second B
  and third C then the angle measured is ABC (as shown in Fig 0.2). Angles are in degrees and run from 0 to 180 clockwise and anticlockwise from the positive x axis
  to the negative x axis.
</p>

<figure>
  <img src="images/physics/MechanicsLabImages/mechLabTutorial0Protractor.PNG" alt="protractor">
  <figcaption> Fig 0.2: The protractor tool measures the inner angle between three points.</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>
The horizontal and vertical axes are useful in a number of simulations, particularly when measuring angles in the momentum simulation; as a
fiducial mark in the simple harmonic motion simulations; or in order to identify positions of constant horizontal or vertical displacement in
the projectiles simulation (see Figures 1.2 and 1.3 as examples). Simply left-click the square at the axes intersection and move to the required position.
</p>

<h3> Help menus </h3>

<p>
  Most of the simulations are pretty intuitive and within a couple of minutes of playing around with it you will have an understanding of how they work
  and what they are doing. However, there can be important, specific information for each and a "Help" button exists in each simulation in order to
  provide this information. An important example is the Orbits simulation: the units used in this simulation are not exactly the most commonly used (ultimately they are
  based on the Astronomical Unit, AU, as the distance unit, rather than the metre) and therefore some useful units are provided here.
</p>

<!--Tutorial 1: Projectiles -->

<h2 id="mechanicslabtutorial1"> Tutorial 1: Projectiles: calculating and measuring height and range</h2>

<p>
  Projectile motion is an important section of Mechanics in A level Physics. The "Projectiles" simulation in Mechanics Lab gives students the
  opportunity to visualise projectile motion, do calculations using 2D equations of motion and to experiment on the effects of adding drag
  and changing the gravitational field strength. A basic gaming element has been added to this simulation: the aim is to hit as many
  target boxes as possible, with a score being tracked for the ratio of hits to shots fired.
</p>

<h3> Measurements and Variables</h3>
<p>
    The ruler tool is available in this scene, allowing the measurement of distances, with the range and height of the target being particularly
    useful. The end of the cannon barrel is the position at which the cannonball has the initial velocity stated at the top of the UI,
    therefore measurements of the height or range should be from this position. This is shown in Fig. 1. Right click to set the starting point for the distance measurement and
    right click again to define the end point. The distance between these two points will be displayed at the bottom of the screen. The horizontal and vertical
    axes will be useful to help measure distances as shown in Fig. 2 and 3. The angle of projection can be changed by left clicking on the cannon barrel itself and moving
    it into position. The initial velocity can be increased and decreased by clicking the corresponding buttons on the UI. The Physics of the simulation can be changed by
    changing the drag coefficient and the gravitational field strength (positive values of g will still act in the negative y direction).
</p>
<p>
    For calculations, it will be important to remember that the angle shown is the angle measured from the horizontal.
</p>

<!-- Example calculation that can be done-->
<h3> Calculating the range of projectile motion</h3>

<p>
  The following equations of motion are useful when considering (no air resistance) projectile motion:
</p>

<p>
    (1.1) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; v = u + at
</p>
<p>
    (1.2) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; s = ut + 0.5at<sup>2</sup>
</p>
<p>
    (1.3) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; v<sup>2</sup> = u<sup>2</sup> + 2as
</p>
<p>
    (1.4) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; s = 0.5(u+v)t
</p>

<p>
  Where u is the initial velocity, v the final velocity, t the time between that initial and final velocity and s is the displacement
  between the initial and final positions. The horizontal range, since acceleration by gravity only occurs in the y (vertical) direction is
  simply found using the basic distance, speed, time relationship: equation (2) with no second term.
</p>
<p>
  <b>TASK 1</b>: Set the initial velocity and angle of the projectile in order to plot a full parabolic curve and not hit the target box (
  don't worry about your score just now). An example is shown in Fig. 3.
</p>
<p>
  <b>TASK 2</b>: Remembering that the initial velocity needs to be resolved into vertical and horizontal components and that we know
  what the value of vertical velocity is at the projectile's maximum height, calculate the time taken to reach this maximum height.
</p>
<p>
  <b>TASK 3</b>: Calculate the horizontal distance covered by the projectile when it reaches its maximum height and use the ruler tool
  with the axes to measure and check your result.
</p>
<p>
  <b>TASK 4</b>: Calculate the maximum height reached and measure it to check your answer.
</p>


<!--Tutorial 2: Momentum -->

<h2 id="mechanicslabtutorial2"> Tutorial 2: Conservation of momentum in 1D and 2D</h2>

<figure>
  <img src="images/physics/mechanicsLabMomentumUI.PNG" alt="mechanicsLab">

<h3> Making measurements </h3>

<p>
    Since the intention of these simulations is to make the student interact, measure and calculate rather than simply be provided with answers,
    it is necessary in the momentum scene to use the ruler and protractor tool in order to study the collisions. The key to making these measurements
    is the fact that each "puck" produces a trail of dots each of which is separated by 0.1 seconds. By measuring the distance between dots separated by
    around 20 intervals (the more the better) and dividing by the total time taken to produce those dots (the number of spaces between dots multiplied by 0.1s) we
    will find the speed.
</p>

<p>
  <b>TASK 1</b>: Click and drag the central black circle on one of the pucks in order to set the initial velocity. Launch the puck and then measure the speed
  using the above technique. Compare your measured value to the initial speed. There is a worked example below.
</p>

<p>
    Like all measurements in Physics, there is some uncertainty and you may find that your measured value was not identical to the initial set value. Errors in the
    ruler measurement are easy to make if you are not careful and it is impossible to be completely accurate with your positioning of the ruler crosshairs on top of dots.
    Also be careful to find the time interval by counting the <b>spaces between dots</b>: this is equal to the <b>number of dots from your first crosshair to the last (including the ones that
    they are on top of) minus 1</b>.
</p>

<h3> Worked example: Speed measurement</h3>

<p>
  In Fig 2.2a we can see that the initial speed was set to 14m/s. After launching, the blue puck produces dots every 0.1s. In Fig 2.1b, the ruler tool has been used to measure the distance over 31 time intervals.
  With a measured distance of 43.5 (metres) and a time interval of 31 x 0.1 (seconds), the speed is:
</p>

<p>
  (2.1) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; v = d/t = 43.5 / 3.1 = <b>14.0</b>(m/s) (to 1dp)
</p>

<p>
  Which is the speed that we initially set.
</p>

    the speed measurement to be made.

</figure>

<h3> 2D Conservation of momentum </h3>

<p>
This example will start with the blue puck moving in only 1 dimension and the yellow puck stationary. In order to set it up, click on the 2D
check box, this allows you to position the blue puck slightly above its starting position (see Fig 2.3a). Uncheck the 2D checkbox to then limit
the motion of the blue puck to the horizontal only.
</p>

<p>
  <b>TASK 2</b>: Setup your momentum simulation in a similar way to Fig 2.3a. Give your puck an initial horizontal velocity by moving the circular vector header.
</p>

<p>
  Clicking launch will then fire the puck at the stated velocity, you should find that the paths look something similar to Fig 2.3b.
</p>

  <figcaption> Fig 2.3: a) The setup and b) launch for the 2D conservation of momentum calculation.

</figure>

<p>
  <b>TASK 3</b>: Measure the speed of each of the pucks after the collision using the technique demonstrated in the worked example above.
</p>

<p>
  <b>TASk 4</b>: For both pucks, measure the angle to the horizontal of the velocity vector. Figure 2.4 gives an example.
</p>

<figure>
  <img src="images/physics/MechanicsLabImages/mechLabAngle1.PNG" alt="angle1">
  <img src="images/physics/MechanicsLabImages/mechLabAngle2.PNG" alt="angle2">
  <figcaption> Fig 2.4: a) Angle measurements for blue puck velocity vector and b) for the yellow puck.
  From Mechanics Lab > Momentum.</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>
  If you kept the mass of each puck the same (i.e. you didn't change either of them from 10kg) then you should find that the angle between the two final
  trajectories is 90 degrees. This is a feature of 2D collisions that should reveal to you that the colliders have equal mass. You should experiment
  with different mass combinations to see what happens when the masses are different.
</p>
<p>
  If momentum is conserved in our simulation then the total final momentum should equal the total initial momentum. Since we are working in 2D
  we need to consider both the horizontal and vertical momentum. Since we only had a horizontal initial velocity the total initial momentum is simply the
  initial horizontal velocity multiplied by the mass.
</p>
<p>
  <b>TASK 5</b>: Calculate the initial horizontal momentum. What is the initial vertical momentum?
</p>

<p>
  After the collision, both pucks move with horizontal (x component in the equations below) and vertical (y) components. It can make the calculations easier
  to simply consider a 2D momentum calculation as two 1D momentum calculatons. The necessary conservation equations are 2.2 and 2.3 below:
</p>

<p>
  (2.2) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b>p</b><sub>x</sub>(initial) = <b>p</b><sub>x</sub>(blue,final) + <b>p</b><sub>x</sub>(yellow,final)
</p>
<p>
  (2.3) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b>p</b><sub>y</sub>(initial) = <b>p</b><sub>y</sub>(blue,final) + <b>p</b><sub>y</sub>(yellow,final)
</p>

<p>
  Remember that the bold signifies that the quantity is a vector and that vector addition is necessary (i.e. velocities up and down or left and right will
  have opposite signs).
</p>

<p>
  <b>TASK 6</b>: Calculate the horizontal component of the blue and yellow pucks. If you followed the above setup then both should be positive (to the right).
  If you add both of the components together you should find that they equal the initial horizontal momentum. Check that they do.
</p>

<p>
  <b>TASK 7</b>: Calculate the vertical component of the blue and yellow pucks. If you followed the above setup then the blue puck will be positive (up) and
  the yellow puck will be negative (down). In this case, when we "add" the vectors, we need to subtract the magnitude of the yellow vertical component from the magnitude of the
  blue vertical component. You should find that the vertical components are equal and opposite, therefore the overall final vertical momentum is zero (as it was to start).
</p>

<p>
  Remember that since we have measured the angle to the horizontal, the horizontal component of the velocity is the cosine component and the vertical component is the sine.
</p>
<p>
  Since vertical and horizontal momenta are conserved, the overall momentum is conserved.
</p>


<!--Tutorial 3: Orbits -->

<h2 id="mechanicslabtutorial3"> Tutorial 3: Orbits: Calculating circular velocity</h2>

<figure>
  <img src="images/physics/MechanicsLabImages/mechLabOrbits.PNG" alt="orbitsOverview">
  <figcaption> Fig 3.1: Overview of the Orbits simulation screen.
  From Mechanics Lab > Orbits.</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>
  The Orbits simulation gives students the opportunity to experiment with many aspects of basic, two body, orbital dynamics, including: varying the mass of each body; varying the
  orbital speed; changing the distance between the bodies; testing calculations; identifying key features of orbits such as Kepler's Laws and applying Newton's Law of Gravitation.
  This tutorial focuses on the circular orbit calculations that are important for IGCSE and A level Physics and how the simulations can be used to test your solutions.
</p>

<h3> Quick note: Units</h3>
<p>
  The Orbits simulation uses slightly unusual units: ultimately, they are all defined by using the Astronomical Unit (AU) as the basic distance measurement (it seemed logical to build the
  simulation from this definition, with 1 unit in Unity equally 1 AU). That means that speeds are measured in AU/s and Newton's Gravitational constant is in units of AU<sup>3</sup>M<sub>o</sub><sup>-1</sup>s<sup>-2</sup>,
  where M<sub>o</sub> is the solar mass. The total energy of the two bodies is also given and is in the units of M<sub>o</sub>AU<sup>2</sup>s<sup>-2</sup>. It should be noted that the energy is calculated relative to the stationary
  "Main Camera" which is the starting view, not the centre of mass frame. Below is a list of useful quantities in these units (some are also given in the Help menu in the simulation itself):
  <ul>
    <li> G = 3.964 x 10<sup>-14</sup> AU<sup>3</sup>M<sub>o</sub><sup>-1</sup>s<sup>-2</sup> </li>
    <li> 1 AU = 1.496 x 10<sup>11</sup> m </li>
    <li> 1 M<sub>o</sub> = 1.989 x 10<sup>30</sup> kg </li>
    <li> 1 M<sub>earth</sub> = 5.972 x 10<sup>24</sup> kg = 3 x 10<sup>-6</sup>M<sub>o</sub></li>
    <li> v<sub>earth</sub> = 1.99 x 10<sup>-7</sup> AU/s </li>
  </ul>

  Where v<sub>earth</sub> is the speed of the Earth in a circular orbit around the Sun at 1 AU distance.
</p>
<p>
  When inputing small values such as velocities in AU/s then simply use <b>scientific notation by typing e or E and then the power term</b>. For example, the circular velocity of the Earth around the Sun is <b>1.99e-7</b>.
</p>

<h3> Quick note: Speed relative to what? </h3>
<p>
  Reference frames are an extremely important consideration in Physics. If we said that a car was stationary whilst parked we only mean relative to the Earth's surface. Look at the car from space and you will see it moving as the Earth
  rotates, or relative to the Sun watch it fly around in an orbit....what about relative to the Milky Way galaxy! In these simulations the speed is calculated relative to the "stationary" Main Camera: some kind of absolute reference frame
  above the centre of the screen. If the centre of mass moves relative to this view then you can change camera to the CoM camera which will allow the CoM to remain stationary relative to the screen view; however, velocities are still calculated
  relative to the original Main Camera. I may attempt to modify this for future releases of Mechanics Lab.
</p>

<h3> Circular Orbits: M >> m </h3>
<p>
  The most common scenario for GCSE and A level questions are circular orbits where the central mass (M) is much, much greater than the orbiting mass (m) and therefore the central mass is considered stationary and all velocities are relative to it. The following
  analysis assumes that you maintain large differences between the Earth and Sun masses in the simulation.
</p>
<p>
  We can see in Fig 3.1 an example of a circular orbit where the central mass is much larger than the orbiting mass (M >> m). In fact this is the starting orbit in the program and simulates the Earth's orbit around the Sun.
  The parameters for this orbit are given in the simulation below the corresponding input fields: speed of the Earth, distance, and speed of the star (which is effectively 0). We can see that the distance remains constant
  (i.e. it is a circular orbit) and that the energy of the orbit is constant and negative as it should be for a bound orbit.
</p>
<p>
  In order to calculate the necessary velocity for a circular orbit we need to combine Newton's Law of gravitation (3.1) with the centripetal force equation (3.2) to form an equation for the circular velocity (3.3).
</p>

<p>
  (3.1) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; F = GMm/r<sup>2</sup>
</p>
<p>
  (3.2) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; F = mv<sup>2</sup>/r
</p>
<p>
  (3.3) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; v<sup>2</sup> = GM/r
</p>

<p>
  <b>TASK 1</b>: Derive Equation 3.3 from the two previous equations. What mass does the small m represent and what is the significance of it
  not being in equation 3.3?
</p>

<p>
  <b>TASK 2</b>: Calculate the circular orbital speed of the Earth around the Sun in AU/s and check that you get the same value that is given in the
  simulation (1.99 x 10<sup>-7</sup> AU/s). Remember, it will be easiest to work in the units given above for G.
</p>

<p>
  <b>TASK 3</b>: Calculate the necessary circular orbit velocity for an Earth mass planet orbiting around a star with three times the mass of the Sun at a distance
  of 2 AU. Input the distance, mass and orbital speed to check that you get a circular orbit.
</p>

<p>
  If you don't input any velocity, the simulation will calculate the circular velocity by default and display it underneath the input field.
</p>
<p>
  The total energy of a circular orbit is given by equation 3.4:
</p>

<p>
  (3.4) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; E = -GMm/2r
</p>

<p>
  <b>OPTIONAL TASK</b>: Try deriving the above equation from the equations for the KE of the planet (we assume the KE of the star is 0) and the gravitational
  potential energy of the system.
</p>

<p>
  <b>TASK 4</b>: Use equation 3.4 to calculate the energy of the orbit in TASK 3 and compare this to the energy given in the simulation. Remember the units that
  we are working in.
</p>

<p>
  <b>TASK 5</b>: Try changing the orbital velocity of the planet slightly. How does this affect the orbital path of the planet? What shape is it now? What happens to
  the orbital velocity throughout the orbit: where is it fastest and slowest? Why?
</p>

<h3> A brief extension on circular orbits: M ~ m </h3>

<p>
  Many stars can be found in binary orbits: two stars orbiting each other. In this case the condition M >> m is not met and the above equations do not hold in exactly the same form.
  If you do want to simulate binary stars then we can calculate the corresponding orbital velocities as follows.
</p>

<p>
  Equation 3.3 can be used in the same form, except the quantities mean slightly different things. In this case the M quantity is given by equation 3.5 below; the speed v is given
  by equation 3.6 and is the sum of the two speeds; and a new quantity &mu;, the reduced mass, is useful and given by equation 3.7. In order to find the individual velocities of our masses
  we also need to use equation 3.8.
</p>

<p>
  (3.5) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; M =  m<sub>1</sub> + m<sub>2</sub>
</p>
<p>
  (3.6) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; v = v<sub>1</sub> + v<sub>2</sub>
</p>
<p>
  (3.7) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &mu; = m<sub>1</sub>.m<sub>2</sub> / (m<sub>1</sub> + m<sub>2</sub>)
</p>
<p>
  (3.8) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; m<sub>1</sub>.v<sub>1</sub> = m<sub>2</sub>.v<sub>2</sub> = &mu;.v
</p>

<h3> A worked example </h3>

<p>
  <b>TASK 6</b>: Consider two stars orbiting each other with circular orbits, m<sub>1</sub> = 1 solar mass and m<sub>2</sub> = 5 solar masses at a distance of 4AU from each other. Try to calculate the individual
  velocities for each of the stars. Input all the information into the Orbits simulation and if you are correct your should find that you get a circular binary system.
</p>

<p>
 <b> Solution:</b> The relative speed v is found as follows:
</p>
<p>
  v<sup>2</sup> = GM/r = 3.964 x 10<sup>-14</sup>.(5 + 1) / 4
</p>
<p>
  v = 2.44 x 10<sup>-7</sup> AU/s

  The reduced mass in this situation is: &mu; =  m<sub>1</sub>.m<sub>2</sub> / (m<sub>1</sub> + m<sub>2</sub>) = 1x5 / (1+5) = 5/6
</p>
<p>
  Using equation 3.8 we can find the individual velocities as follows:
</p>
<p>
  v<sub>1</sub> = &mu;.v/m<sub>1</sub> = (5/6).(2.44 x 10<sup>-7</sup>) / 1 = 2.03 x 10<sup>-7</sup> AU/s
</p>
<p>
  v<sub>2</sub> = &mu;.v/m<sub>2</sub> = (5/6).(2.44 x 10<sup>-7</sup>) / 5 = 4.07 x 10<sup>-8</sup> AU/s
</p>

<p>
  One important thing to remember is that these two stars have different signs to their velocities (as one moves up the other moves down etc). Therefore, when we input the velocity you must remember to
  <b>make one of the velocities negative</b>.
