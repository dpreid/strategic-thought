      <!--Beta version explanation -->
      <p>
        The WebGL build embedded below shows the basic functionality of the simulation and is available
        at <a href="https://simmer.io/@dpreid/opticslab"> simmer.io </a>. C# code for the
        simulation is available at <a href="https://github.com/dpreid/opticsLab"> Mechanics Lab </a>.
        Mechanics Lab is still very much in a development stage and although the Physics is almost fully functional, the
        user interfaces, overall design and large parts of the functionality are still missing. However, there is still some
        useful Physics that can be done with it.
      </p>



      <!--Introduction -->
      <p>
          Mechanics Lab is a series of Physics simulations on many important areas of classical mechanics from GCSE and A level Physics.
          Currently, it has simulations for adding vectors, moments, projectiles, simple harmonic motion, friction and orbits. Tutorials
          for teachers and students will appear below with examples of possible experiments and the measurements that can be done with
          the Mechanics Lab software. An embedded version is below.
      </p>
      <p>
          Downloadable, standalone versions of the software will be available in the future.
      </p>

<h2 id="mechanicslabtutorial1"> Tutorial 1: Projectiles: calculating and measuring height and range</h2>

<p>
  Projectile motion is an important section of Mechanics in A level Physics. The "Projectiles" level of Mechanics Lab gives students the
  opportunity to visualise projectile motion, do calculations using 2D equations of motion and to experiment on the effects of adding drag
  and changing the gravitational field strength. A basic gaming element has been added to this simulation: the aim is to hit as many
  target boxes as possible, with a score being tracked for the ratio of hits to shots fired.
</p>

<h3> Measurements and Variables</h3>
<p>
    The ruler tool is available in this scene, allowing the measurement of distances, with the range and height of the target being particularly
    useful. The end of the cannon barrel is the position at which the cannonball has the initial velocity stated at the top of the UI,
    therefore measurements of the height or range should be from this position. This is shown in Fig. 1. Right click to set the starting point for the distance measurement and
    right click again to define the end point. The distance between these two points will be displayed at the bottom of the screen. The horizontal and vertical
    axes will be useful to help measure distances as shown in Fig. 2 and 3. The angle of projection can be changed by left clicking on the cannon barrel itself and moving
    it into position. The initial velocity can be increased and decreased by clicking the corresponding buttons on the UI. The Physics of the simulation can be changed by
    changing the drag coefficient and the gravitational field strength (positive values of g will still act in the negative y direction).
</p>
<p>
    For calculations, it will be important to remember that the angle shown is the angle measured from the horizontal.

<!-- Example calculation that can be done-->
<h3> Calculating the range of projectile motion</h3>

<p>
  The following equations of motion are useful when considering (no air resistance) projectile motion:
</p>

<p>
    (1) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; v = u + at
</p>
<p>
    (2) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; s = ut + 0.5at<sup>2</sup>
</p>
<p>
    (3) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; v<sup>2</sup> = u<sup>2</sup> + 2as
</p>
<p>
    (4) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; s = 0.5(u+v)t
</p>

<p>
  Where u is the initial velocity, v the final velocity, t the time between that initial and final velocity and s is the displacement
  between the initial and final positions. The horizontal range, since acceleration by gravity only occurs in the y (vertical) direction is
  simply found using the basic distance, speed, time relationship: equation (2) with no second term.
</p>
<p>
  <b>TASK 1</b>: Set the initial velocity and angle of the projectile in order to plot a full parabolic curve and not hit the target box (
  don't worry about your score just now). An example is shown in Fig. 3.
</p>
<p>
  <b>TASK 2</b>: Remembering that the initial velocity needs to be resolved into vertical and horizontal components and that we know
  what the value of vertical velocity is at the projectile's maximum height, calculate the time taken to reach this maximum height.
</p>
<p>
  <b>TASK 3</b>: Calculate the horizontal distance covered by the projectile when it reaches its maximum height and use the ruler tool
  with the axes to measure and check your result.
</p>
<p>
  <b>TASK 4</b>: Calculate the maximum height reached and measure it to check your answer.
