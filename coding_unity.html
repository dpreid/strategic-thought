<h2 id="opticsLab"> Optics Lab </h2>

<p>
  Optics Lab is a set of simulations of optical systems developed in Unity. Ultimately, it is intended as an educational resource
  for the study of IGCSE and A level Physics. Ray transfer matrices are used
  for the calculations of ray paths through lenses and mirrors. Currently it includes thin convex and concave lenses,
  parallel prisms, spherical and plane mirrors as well as systems such as refracting and reflecting telescopes. The C# scripts that are used to calculate ray paths as well as the
  run the UI can be downloaded from my <a href="https://github.com/dpreid/opticsLab"> OpticsLab </a> repository on GitHub.
  I am currently working on getting the ray tracing functional, I will then develop the calculations/measurements that
  can be done - angular magnification, refractive index, image distance etc - before polishing up the graphics and optimizing.
</p>
<p>
  The WebGL build embedded below shows the basic functionality of the simulation (now on version 0.2). It is at a lower quality than the
  standalone build that it is available at <a href="https://github.com/dpreid/opticsLab"> OpticsLab </a>.

  <h2 id="eclipse"> Solar Eclipse simulation </h2>
  <p>
    Another fairly basic simulation, this time of solar eclipses. This is in no way an accurate simulation of the
    frequency at which eclipses will occur as the orbital motion of the Earth and Moon are not simulated accurately. Relative
    sizes of Sun, Earth and Moon are accurate, as are mean relative distances. The Moon's inclination to the ecliptic is necessarily
    included to demonstrate why solar eclipses do not occur each time the Moon moves between the Earth and Sun. The Milky Way
    skybox was created by Adam Bielecki.
  </p>

  <p>
    The slider sets the relative speed of the simulation: we don't want to have to wait literal years to simulate an eclipse. The bottom
    left camera shows the phase of the Moon. The cameras on the right show the Sun from positions in the Southern hemisphere (bottom), along the
    ecliptic plane (centre) and from the Northern hemisphere (top). This is to give an idea of why any single solar eclipse is only full from a relatively
    small area of the Earth.

        <h2 id="DLA"> Diffusion Limited Aggregation simulation </h2>
        <p>
            I wanted to test out Unity as a possible resource in creating educational simulations for teaching physics.
            As a first test of its potential, I simulated Diffusion Limited Aggregation in 3D. In later iterations I may add
            calculations of the fractal dimension of the growth formed, but for now the interactivity is limited to changing
            the attractive potential of the central "seed".
