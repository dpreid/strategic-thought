      <!--Tutorial 1: Vectors in Unity and C# -->
      <h2 id="codingTutorial1"> Tutorial 1: Using vectors in Unity and C#</h2>

<p>
  Understanding the application of vectors is at the heart of many areas of Physics: particularly in Mechanics. Understanding the motion
  of bodies relies on understanding the forces that act on them and that force and the corresponding acceleration, velocity and displacement
  are all vector quantities. When attempting to create graphical simulations of physical systems it is also vital to have a grasp of vectors
  for correctly implementing graphical user interfaces and changing the position of graphical elements on the screen. Therefore, this tutorial
  will focus on how vectors can be implemented in Unity and C# to code basic physics elements of the "Physics Labs" simulations.
</p>

  <h3>The Vector3 class</h3>
<p>
  Rather than construct our vectors from scratch using float arrays or some other data structure, we can use the UnityEngine Vector3 structure instead.
  This is particularly useful due to the methods that already exist for this class, including: dot and cross products, rotating the vector, normalizing and
  finding the angle between vectors.
</p>
<p>
  One very important use of vectors is in the positioning and orientation of GameObjects in Unity. All GameObjects (with a transform component) have a local
  x, y and z axis that rotates relative to the global x, y and z coordinates. In Unity, the x axis is red, the y axis is green and the z axis is blue.
  Examples of accessing and manipulating this transform component will be given later.
</p>

    Unity editor. Taken from Mechanics Lab > Projectile scene.</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>
  The documentation for the Vector3 class can be found at <a href="https://docs.unity3d.com/ScriptReference/Vector3.html"> Unity: Vector3</a>.
</p>
<p>
  The constructor for the Vector3 class is relatively straightforward, we simply need to assign the x, y and z components of our vector. The Vector3 class
  also has a lot of inbuilt methods: both for shorthand assignment of common vectors and vector algebra. The code below gives an example of the basic constructor
  and of a few examples of the inbuilt methods.
</p>
<code>
  Vector3 vector_1 = Vector3(1,1,1); &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; //the identity vector<br>
  Vector3 vector_2 = Vector3.one; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; //shorthand way of creating the identity vector<br>
  Vector3 vector_3 = Vector3.right; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; //shorthand for (1,0,0) the red axis for your component in Unity<br>
  Vector3 vector_4 = Vector3.up; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; //shorthand for (0,1,0) the green axis<br>
  Vector3 vector_5 = Vector3.forward; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; //shorthand for (0,0,1) the blue axis<br>
  Vector3 vector_6 = Vector3.Angle(Vector3 a, Vector3 b); &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; //returns the angle between vectors a and b<br>
  Vector3 vector_7 = Vector3.SignedAngle(Vector3 a, Vector3 b, Vector3 axis); &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; //returns the signed angle between vectors a and b around the specified axis<br>
  Vector3 vector_8 = Vector3.Distance(Vector3 a, Vector3 b); &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; //returns the distance between vectors a and b<br>
  Vector3 vector_9 = Vector3.Reflect(Vector3 original, Vector3 normal); &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; //returns the original vector reflected of a surface defined by the normal vector<br>
</code>
<p>
  Basic vector arithmetic can be performed on Vector3 objects by using the same notation as with normal scalar arithmetic:
</p>
<code>
  Vector3 a = new Vector3(1,1,1);<br>
  Vector b = new Vector(2,2,2);<br>
  Vector c = a + b; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; // vector addition<br>
  Vector d = 2*a; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; // multiplying by a scalar.<br>
</code>

<h3>Electric field example</h3>
<p>
  As I hope that these tutorials could help in development of your own simulations, I will use examples from the code I use in the
  "labs" apps. During this tutorial I will mainly refer to the electromagnetic simulations from (the soon to be released) Fields Lab.
</p>
Coulomb's Law gives us the electric field at a displacement <b>r</b> from a point charge.
<p>
(1.1) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b>E</b> = (1/4&pi;&epsilon;<sub>0</sub>)Q/|r<sup>2</sup>|.<i>r</i>
</p>
<p>
  Where <b>bold</b> denotes a vector and <i>italic</i> a unit vector.
</p>
<p>
  The unit vector <i>r</i> can be expressed as:
</p>
<p>
(1.2) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <i>r</i> = <b>r</b>/|r|
</p>
<p>
  Where the |r| is the magnitude of <b>r</b>, simply the distance from the point charge to the position in question.
  This means that we can re-express the electric field as:
</p>
<p>
  (1.3) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b>E</b> = (1/4&pi;&epsilon;<sub>0</sub>)Q/|r<sup>3</sup>|.<b>r</b>
</p>
<p>
  Positions are stored as Vector3 structures themselves, therefore in order to find the vector <b>r</b> we need to do some vector
  addition. The point charge is a GameObject in Unity (a sphere) with a Transform component attached to it which stores the position
  and scale of the object. To access the position of the point charge we can use the following code:
</p>
        <code>
          public GameObject charge;     //the charge object can then be assigned to this variable in the Unity editor<br>
          ...                           //Start() and Update() methods<br>
          ...<br>
<br>
          <b>Vector3 charge_position = charge.transform.position;</b><br>
<br>
      </code>
<p>
    It may be that you want to calculate the electric field at a position when you click, or at some other GameObject, but for this
    example we will assign a vector position at which we will calculate the field strength called p:
</p>
        <code>
          Vector3 p = new Vector3(5,6,7);   //this is how we assign vectors -> (x,y,z)
      </code>

<p>
  Our vector <b>r</b>, which is the displacement from the charge to the position p, is then found by:
</p>
<p>
  <code>
    private Vector3 CalculateElectricField(Vector3 charge_position, Vector3 p, float charge){ <br>
        <b>Vector3 r = p - charge_position;</b><br>
        float r_mag = r.magnitude;<br>
        Vector3 E_field = (coulomb_constant * charge / (r_mag * r_mag * r_mag))*r;       //electric field vector<br>
        return E_field;<br>
</code>
</p>
<p>
  This line of code is inside the method for calculating the electric field, the remainder of which is the code version of
  equation (1.3) and includes a coulomb_constant float value that would be assigned in the Start() method.
</p>
<p>
  In order to get the unit vector <i>r</i> we could also use the normalize method for Vector3 structures:
</p>
        <code>
          Vector3 r_unit = r.normalized;
      </code>
<p>
    The electric field visualisation simulation in Fields Lab requires that the small vector arrows align themselves along the electric field
    vector lines. The use of vectors allows us to easily rotate objects. The method used in Fields Lab is shown below:
</p>
<code>
  float angle = Vector3.SignedAngle(transform.right, E_field_total, Vector3.forward); &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
  transform.Rotate(transform.forward, angle);
</code>
<p>
  The first line of code finds the angle in degrees between the x axis of the object that we want to rotate and the electric field vector.
  The x axis of the object that we are rotating is found using the shorthand "transform.right" where transform in Unity is always the Transform
  component of whatever object the script is attached to. The SignedAngle is given a positive or negative value depending on whether it has to
  rotate clockwise or anti-clockwise to rotate from the first to the second vector around the defined axis: in this case the z component (Vector3.forward).
  The second line of code then actually rotates the object the angle calculated in the first line around the local z axis (transform.forward). Running this
  code in the Update() method (or more usually the FixedUpdate() method for Physics simulations that are dependent on consistent time delays between calculations)
  means that the object will always face along the electric field vector.
</p>
<p>
  The C# scripts used in all the "labs" are available on <a href="https://github.com/dpreid/">GitHub</a>. Feel free to download and modify and use them in your own projects if they are in anyway useful
  to you: a brief mention of this site would be appreciated and maybe a small donation if I have got that up and running yet. Please also leave a comment as I would be
  very interested in knowing that it is being useful for others.
