      <p>
        Currently, this page is a small album of photographs taken from central Tokyo with
        my Celestron 6SE. Cloud, haze and the light pollution of one of the most populated cities
        on the planet make it difficult to pick out a single constellation by eye on most evenings and it
        is a continual surprise to me (even as a Physics teacher) how much detail can be developed
        with (relatively) basic equipment, a little patience and a whole lot of exposures.
</p>
<p>
        I hope ultimately to write more about the software and techniques required to process astrophotographs,
        but these basic photos will have to do as a placeholder for now.
</p<
<p>
  Equipment:
        <ul>
          <li> Celestron 6SE Schmidt Cassegrain telescope</li>
          <li> Nikon D5500 camera </li>
          <li> Celstron colour and moon filters </li>
          <li> Logicool webcam </li>
          <li> Software: IRIS and PIPP </li>

        </ul>
      </p>

      </figure>

      <p> Hardly the greatest photo of Jupiter ever taken and I was disappointed with my poor
        camera maintenence, allowing a huge piece of dust/dirt/general mankiness to ruin the photo.
        I cleaned up my camera and will need to make another attempt... better seeing and longer
        exposure, for better still selection, will hopefully sharpen it up. Apart from combining
        exposures, not much has been done to enhance the image, so playing around with sharpness
        settings in particular may help improve things.
