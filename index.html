      <p>This page is mainly intended as a storage space for the code, simulations and puzzles
        that I enjoy creating and solving as part of my job as a Physics teacher and as a general interest.
        It is also useful to demonstrate some of the code that I have made available on GitHub, including code
        written for a computational astrophysics research project I completed, Arduino code for a robotics
        class I run, puzzle solutions from algorithmic puzzle books and the project euler website and test code written
        in C# for the game engine Unity.
      </p>

      <p>
          The languages I tend to code in are Java, Python, C# and Octave. As far as coding goes I am pretty much
          self-taught - Coursera, Udemy, Udacity and MITOpenCourseware have been fantastic sources of knowledge as well as
          the invaluable Stack Overflow site - and am certainly not an expert. I am certain that a lot of my code
          is bloated and inefficient, so any feedback is more than welcome. With Masters degrees in both Theoretical Physics
          and Astrophysics and a love for solving puzzles, my code tends to aim to simulate physical systems or find solutions
          to algorithmic problems rather than being complex, optimized computer science code. Everything on this site is free to
          use and adapt for your own use - but if you do use it, a reference to this site and author would be nice.
