  <h2> What is DataTableTop</h2>
  <p>
    DataTableTop is a simple GUI for storing and tracking boardgame scores. Any number of games and players
    can be saved and data can be displayed in terms of individual players, individual games, overall ranks and
    changes over time. The players, scores and winning faction/character are entered into the program whereby all players
    are awarded a normalized score based on their percentage of the winning players score in that game. In this way,
    high scoring games are not overpowered. Three ranking systems can be displayed: total points earned, average points per game
    and overall win percentage. Achievements are awarded to players for reaching certain milestones - more will be
    implemented in the future.
  </p>
  <p>
    DataTableTop was programmed in Java using the WindowsBuilder add on to Eclipse IDE.

  <h2> Installing/Using </h2>
  <p>
    Download the DataTableTop files from GitHub:
</p>
<p>
    <a href="https://github.com/dpreid/dataTableTop"><font size="5" color="BLUE"> https://github.com/dpreid/dataTableTop</font> </a>
</p>
<p>
    Double-click the GameLogger executable file to launch. On close, a game_data and player_data files are
    generated, containing the stored data for all games and players. A CSV file "gamescores" is also generated
    which is used to create the lists in the program as well as being a backup of games played.
